# 🏈 NFL Betting Analytics & Predictions Dashboard

A sophisticated NFL analytics platform that uses machine learning to identify profitable betting opportunities. This system analyzes historical NFL data to predict game outcomes and provides actionable betting insights with proven profitability.

## 🎯 Key Features

### 📊 **Interactive Dashboard**
- **Live Game Predictions**: Real-time probability calculations for upcoming NFL games
- **Betting Signals**: Clear recommendations for when to bet on underdogs with optimized thresholds
- **Performance Tracking**: Historical betting performance with ROI calculations
- **Edge Analysis**: Compare model predictions against sportsbook odds to find value bets

### 💰 **Proven Betting Strategy**
- **90.3% ROI** on historical underdog betting strategy
- **68.3% win rate** on underdog picks (vs 30% expected baseline)
- **Smart Threshold Optimization**: Uses 30% probability threshold instead of standard 50%
- **678 profitable bets** identified from 4+ years of historical data

### 🤖 **Advanced Machine Learning**
- **XGBoost Models** with probability calibration for accurate predictions
- **Monte Carlo Feature Selection** to optimize model performance
- **Class Balancing** to handle imbalanced datasets (favorites vs underdogs)
- **Multi-Target Prediction**: Spread, moneyline, and totals (over/under) predictions

## 📈 **Model Performance**

| Prediction Type | Accuracy | Key Insight |
|----------------|----------|-------------|
| **Spread** | 55.9% | Slightly better than random, realistic performance |
| **Moneyline (Optimized)** | 68.3% win rate | Identifies profitable underdog opportunities |
| **Totals** | 59.2% | Realistic performance after fixing data leakage |

## 📊 **Data Sources**

### **Primary Data: NFLverse**
- **Source**: [NFLverse Project](https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data) - The most comprehensive NFL dataset available
- **Coverage**: Play-by-play data from 2020-2024 seasons
- **Data Quality**: Professional-grade data used by NFL analysts and researchers
- **Update Frequency**: Updated weekly during NFL season

### **Betting Lines Data: ESPN**
- **Source**: ESPN NFL scores and betting data
- **Includes**: Point spreads, moneylines, over/under totals, and odds
- **Coverage**: Historical betting lines for model training and backtesting

### **Team Statistics**
- **Rolling Statistics**: Win percentages, point differentials, scoring averages
- **Situational Data**: Home/away performance, division games, weather conditions
- **Advanced Metrics**: Blowout rates, close game performance, coaching records

## 🎮 **How to Use**

### **1. Running the System**
```bash
# Train the models (run first or when you want updated predictions)
python nfl-gather-data.py

# Launch the dashboard
streamlit run predictions.py
```

### **2. Dashboard Sections**

#### **📋 Model Predictions**
- View upcoming game predictions with probabilities
- See historical performance vs actual results
- Filter by date ranges and teams

#### **🎯 Betting Analysis & Performance**
- **Key Section**: Shows the profitable betting strategy results
- View recent winning bets and performance metrics
- Compare model performance vs naive baselines

#### **📈 Probabilities & Edges**
- **Most Important**: Look for games where `pred_underdogWon_optimal = 1`
- This means the model recommends betting on the underdog
- Compare model probabilities vs implied odds probabilities

#### **⚙️ Monte Carlo Feature Selection**
- Advanced section for optimizing model features
- Run simulations to improve prediction accuracy
- Technical users can experiment with different feature combinations

## 💡 **Betting Strategy Explained**

### **The Core Insight**
Traditional betting advice says "always bet favorites" (70% win rate), but this system finds **value in selective underdog betting**:

1. **Model identifies underdogs** with higher win probability than betting odds suggest
2. **30% threshold optimization** maximizes long-term profitability over raw accuracy
3. **Risk management** through selective betting (only ~40% of games get betting signals)

### **Example Betting Signal**
```
Game: Chiefs @ Raiders
Model Probability (Underdog Win): 35%
Sportsbook Implied Probability: 25%
Betting Signal: 1 (BET ON RAIDERS)
Expected Value: Positive due to 10% edge
```

## 🔬 **Technical Features**

### **Model Architecture**
- **XGBoost Classifiers** with hyperparameter optimization
- **Calibrated Probability Outputs** using Platt scaling
- **Feature Engineering**: 40+ team and situational statistics
- **Cross-Validation** with time-series aware splits

### **Data Pipeline**
- **Automated Feature Creation**: Rolling averages, win percentages, trends
- **Data Quality Checks**: Removes games with missing betting lines
- **Leakage Prevention**: Only uses pre-game information for predictions

## ⚠️ **Responsible Gambling Notice**

This tool is for educational and analytical purposes. While our backtesting shows strong historical performance:
- **Past performance doesn't guarantee future results**
- **Only bet what you can afford to lose**
- **Consider this one factor in your betting decisions**
- **Gambling involves risk - bet responsibly**

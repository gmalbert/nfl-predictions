## üí° **Betting Strategy Explained**

### **The Core Insight**
Traditional betting advice says "always bet favorites" (70% win rate), but this system finds **value in selective underdog betting**:

1. **Model identifies underdogs** with higher win probability than betting odds suggest
2. **24% threshold optimization** maximizes F1-score for better long-term profitability
3. **Risk management** through selective betting (only ~72% of games get betting signals)

### **Example Betting Signal**
```
Game: Chiefs @ Raiders
Model Probability (Underdog Win): 30%
Sportsbook Implied Probability: 22%
Betting Signal: 1 (BET ON RAIDERS)
Threshold: ‚â•28% (F1-optimized, leak-free)
Expected Value: Positive due to 8% edge
ROI Expectation: 60.9% based on historical performance
```

   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas numpy xgboost scikit-learn
   ```

2. **Train Initial Models**
   ```bash
   python nfl-gather-data.py
   ```

3. **Launch Dashboard**
   ```bash
   streamlit run predictions.py
   ```

4. **Start Analyzing**
   - Check "Show Betting Analysis & Performance" for ROI metrics
   - Look for `pred_underdogWon_optimal = 1` in upcoming games
   - Use the edge calculations to find the best value bets

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

**"TypeError: 'str' object cannot be interpreted as an integer"**
- **Cause**: Old Streamlit version compatibility issue
- **Fix**: Updated in recent version - use `git pull` to get latest fixes

**"Missing file: nfl_history_2020_2024.csv.gz"**
- **Cause**: Large file not available locally
- **Fix**: Dashboard includes error handling and fallback data display

**"Betting signals don't match 30% threshold"**
- **Cause**: Documentation was incorrect (now fixed)
- **Reality**: Model uses 24% F1-optimized threshold, not 30%

### **Performance Notes**
- **Training time**: ~5-10 minutes with optimized parameters (300 estimators)
- **Monte Carlo time**: ~3-5 minutes for feature selection (200 iterations, 15-feature subsets)  
- **Dashboard load time**: ~10-30 seconds for full data processing
- **Memory usage**: ~500MB-1GB during model training with enhanced features

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **KeyError: Features not in index**
- **Cause**: Feature list mismatch between training and dashboard files
- **Solution**: Run `python nfl-gather-data.py` to regenerate feature files and ensure synchronization
- **Prevention**: Both files now auto-sync feature lists to prevent future mismatches

#### **"TypeError: 'str' object cannot be interpreted as an integer"**
- **Cause**: Old Streamlit version compatibility issue
- **Solution**: System now includes modern Streamlit compatibility - use `git pull` for latest fixes

#### **"Missing file: nfl_history_2020_2024.csv.gz"**
- **Cause**: Large file not available locally (Git LFS)
- **Solution**: Dashboard includes graceful error handling and fallback data display
- **Alternative**: Download manually or use Git LFS: `git lfs pull`

#### **Monte Carlo Feature Selection Errors**
- **Cause**: Trying to sample features not available in processed dataset
- **Solution**: Fixed - system now validates feature availability before sampling
- **Features**: Enhanced error handling with automatic feature filtering

#### **ValueError: DataFrame.dtypes for data must be int, float, bool or category**
- **Cause**: XGBoost receiving non-numeric columns (object data types like team names, coaches)
- **Solution**: Fixed - automatic filtering to numeric/boolean/categorical data types only
- **Prevention**: All model inputs now validated for XGBoost compatibility before training

#### **Dashboard Won't Load / Port Already in Use**
- **Solution**: Use different port: `streamlit run predictions.py --server.port=XXXX`
- **Default ports**: Try 8501, 8502, 8503, etc.
- **Terminal**: Check for running Streamlit processes with `tasklist | findstr streamlit`

### **Performance Optimization Tips**
- **Faster Loading**: Use `@st.cache_data` decorator for expensive operations (already implemented)
- **Memory Management**: Dashboard automatically handles large datasets with chunking
- **Feature Selection**: Start with smaller Monte Carlo iterations (50-100) for faster testing
